Batch submission scripts for omega-pi fitter

submit.py
- submits batch jobs to run fits with randomized starting parameters
- user provides list of upper and lower bounds for omega-pi mass range included in fit
- user provides path to input files for fitting

runFit.csh
- script which is executed by the batch job
- copy necessary config files and scripts to local directory
- execute runOrientation.py to fit single orientation
- move results to output directory

runOrientation.py
- link input files for fit in local directory
- replace temporary strings in config file like polarization angle (ANGLE) and t, E, mass cuts (TEMSTRING)
- run fit with randomized starting parameters which can be changed with numRand
- run omegapi_plotter to compute fit fractions and fill histograms of intensity for certain amplitudes
